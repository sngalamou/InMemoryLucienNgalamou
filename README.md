Website for information on Dr. Lucien Aime Ngalamou Pideu.

The Ngalamou Family has suffered the most unimaginable loss: the death of their Father,riend Dr. Lucien Aim√© Ngalamou, Professor of Computer Engineering at Lewis University in Romeoville.  

Dr. Ngalamou, a gentle soul, was heading home from church on Saturday, August 19th, 2023 when his vehicle was struck. Our beloved did not survive the injuries and left this world unexpectedly. His last activity on earth was worship.  

Dr. Ngalamou needs to be brought to his final home (Bafang, Cameroon) so that he can have the memorial that he deserves. The Ngalamou family is asking for your kind donations to help cover the immense financial burden that comes along with something as complicated and sudden as this. Your donations will be used to help bring Dr. Ngalamou home (Bafang, Cameroon), funeral costs, flight tickets to Cameroon.  

We thank you for your generosity as we navigate this heartbreaking loss. Dr. Ngalamou's memory will forever live on in our hearts.
